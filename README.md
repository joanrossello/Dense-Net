# Dense-Net Regularisation and Cross-Validation
* Implement DenseNet3 with data augmentation using the Cutout algorithm.
* Make the cutout mask size and location to be uniformly sampled and visualise the implementation.
* Train the network and report test set results in terms of classification accuracy versus epochs.
* Perform an ablation study that compares DenseNet with ReLU versus Leaky ReLU activation functions, using 3-fold cross-validation.
* Report a summary of loss values, speed, and accuracy on training and validation.
* Compare results between models with and without cross-validation.
